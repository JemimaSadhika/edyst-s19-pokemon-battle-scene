<h3>The frontend has static and index.html.

The static folder has stylesheet(app.css) and images used to display the page.</h3>

<h4>How to run the project:</h4>

1. Download the entire frontend folder  and place them into one folder.

2. Type the folder path to the file index.html in the browser url bar.

3. Refresh the browser to see two pokemons battling with each other.

<h4>NOTE:</h4>

1. If proper path to index.html is not pasted in the browser then the "file cannot be found".

2. If images are not placed in the same "static" folder then just the name of the image will be displayed on the browser.
